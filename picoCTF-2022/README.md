  <h3>Description</h3>
	The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! <br/>
	<s>Connect to the program with netcat:</s><br/> 
	<s>$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49700</s><br/>
  <i>Use <code>1.basic-file-exploit.out</code> instead</i><br/>
	The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/LogicBypass/CTF-s/blob/main/picoCTF-2022/1.basic-file-exploit/1.basic-file-exploit.c "Source Code") <br/>
